<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a technologies-fan, who recently graduated from a governmental university with a BSc degree in mechanical engineering. Currently am working on advancing my skill towards computer technologies. Am taking a course on Full stack web development from Angela Yu, who is a well known coach on web development and programming courses. Hopefully, after earning a full stack web developer certificate from this course, i'll updagrade my self and specialize on advanced level programming and development areas. Then after, I'll get a remote job. I also have a plan on continueing my second degree in my mechanical engineering background. I am also looking for a way of how to integrate this passion of myself--being a programmer as well as an engineer, so that I can build a very advanced profile, to make an impact and become a problem solver, which then would enable me to make a meaningfull impact with in my country as well as to the world.</p>
